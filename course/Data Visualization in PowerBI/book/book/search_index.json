Creating basic PowerBI reports knowledge is prerequisite for this course. By the end of this course Data Analysts should be able to: + Customize Report pages. + Decide for appropriate visualizations type. + To utilize PowerBI native visualizations. + Format and configure PowerBI native visuals. + Configure conditional formatting. + Import their own custom R or Python Visuals. + Utilize Slicers and Filters. + Adjust visuals for accessibility. + Configure automatic page refresh. + Create paginated reports.

Over 200,000 TLC licensees complete approximately 1,000,000 trips each day. For the sake of educational purposes Data Analysts should think of an Imaginary situation where NYC TLC has asked them to prepare a PowerBI report for their c-suite executives and decision managers to better under stand their monthly operations in general and track their daily and monthly KPIs. 2.2 Objectives 2.2.1 General Creating an easy to read and understand descriptive dashboard. Quick one look dynamic status updates. Tracking daily and weekly KPIs. Understanding revenue breakdown. 2.2.2 Requested Is there a specific day of week that NYC TLC should deploy more licensees? Is there a specific time of day that NYC TLC should deploy more licensees? 2.2.3 Extra Mining for relations between trip duration, distance and fare.
